These are my challenge for a problem "manually space splitter".
// @see http://okada.hateblo.jp/entry/2011/11/29/152632

My Answers are below:

01_loop_splitter.js
 -> My first approach to solve the problem. (15 mins)
02_recursive_splitter.js
 -> Surely, loop algorithm can be converted to recursive one.
    This is my second approach.
    However, it took long time to design simple interface of the inner recursive function. (40 mins)
03_divide_conquer_splitter.js
 -> I tried to solve by divide and conquer algorithm. This was so tough approach.
    It took some hours to fix bugs. The code is not simple. (3 hours)
04_async_splitter.js
 -> This is a joke code:-)
    In my project, to improve performance, we adopt buffering and asynchronous pattern.
    This is a so much simple emulation of it.
