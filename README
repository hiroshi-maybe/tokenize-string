Reinvent the wheel: Splitting up a string with space.

01_loop_splitter.js
 -> First approach to solve the problem. (15 mins)
02_recursive_splitter.js
 -> Surely, loop algorithm can be converted to recursive one.
03_divide_conquer_splitter.js
 -> Divide and conquer algorithm. This was so tough approach.
04_async_splitter.js
 -> This is a joke code:-)

* Not sensitive to some cases, such as doubled space "a  b" should be ["a","","","b"] or ["a","","b"]
